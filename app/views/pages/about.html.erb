    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:10px">From an early age, I have always been interested in computers. I started learning how to program in 7th grade on my own, and once I reached 9th grade I was able to take my first real programming class. In 10th grade, I was lucky enough to take my high school's only AP Computer Science course, and ended up passing the class with flying colors.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have utilized resources outside of my school in order to learn more about programming. Currently I am using Pluralsight to learn about Java development, and in the past I have done a Ruby on Rails bootcamp.</p>
